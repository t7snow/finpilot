1. include guards - prevent from breaking if i include in same file twice ( if not defined yet define and run)
2. includes
3. oublic !Object : inheritance
4. The QObject Macro -> triggers the MOC (Meta Object COmpiler) writes a moc_MyObject.cpp behind the scenes. Allows signals / slots to work 


MOC: C++ is static language (forgets class names and shit once compiled) Qt needs information at run time for signals and slots.
MOC Scans -> Looks for Q_OBJECT -> Creates new files->moc_cpp works by doing lokups , introspection, properties
