1. default constructor -> when no constructor is given

2. parameterized constructor -> allows us to pass arguments to constructors, help intiializae membersconstructor sbody intializes things

 A(int x) {
        val = x;
    }

3. copy constructor another of the same class as an argument
	so i would create an A and then send that in to make another A , basically a copy of it

A(A& a) {
        val = a.val;
    }


4. EXPLICIT -> always mark constructor as explicit if it takes one argument 
	-> why? -> *immplicit conversion* which is bad for this

// App.cpp
App::App(QObject *parent)
    : QObject(parent),        // 1. Initialize Base Class first
      m_engine("data.csv"),   // 2. Initialize Engine with its own arguments
      m_username("Guest"),    // 3. Initialize string
      m_refreshRate(1000),    // 4. Initialize integer
      m_isOnline(false)       // 5. Initialize boolean
{
    // The Constructor Body
    // By the time you reach this curly brace, all variables above are 
    // ALREADY created and ready to use.
    
    qDebug() << "App started for user:" << m_username;
}

this is intializing everyting in the .cpp
the connect() go inside the constructor body. the : QObject(parent), m_engine() etc

you put shit in the constructor when something is taken in to make it. Like the  

App::App(QObject *parent) -> this is the actual argument thing
: QObject(parent) -> this is setting the qobject to take in its parent
